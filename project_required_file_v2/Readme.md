Greetings from Edureka!

We understand that you want to understand the yaml file you have shared. 

The YAML snippet you provided is a part of a Kubernetes Deployment manifest. This manifest is used to define how a specific application or workload should be deployed and managed in a Kubernetes cluster.

Here's an explanation of the different fields in this Deployment manifest:

kind: This field specifies the Kubernetes resource type, which, in this case, is a Deployment. A Deployment is used to declaratively manage a set of replica Pods.

apiVersion: Specifies the API version for the Deployment. In this case, it's using the "apps/v1" API version, which is common for Deployments.

metadata: This section contains metadata about the Deployment, such as its name. In this example, the Deployment is named "abctechnologies-dep."

spec: The spec section defines the desired state of the Deployment, including the desired number of replicas, update strategy, and other parameters.

replicas: 2: This field specifies that you want to maintain two replicas of the application. Kubernetes will ensure that two identical Pods are running.

minReadySeconds: 45: This field specifies the minimum number of seconds that a new Pod must be running and ready without any errors before it's considered as "ready." This helps to ensure that new Pods are stable before old Pods are scaled down during updates.

strategy: This section specifies the update strategy for the Deployment.

type: RollingUpdate: This indicates that the Deployment should use a rolling update strategy when making changes to the application. Rolling updates gradually replace old Pods with new ones to ensure zero-downtime deployments.

rollingUpdate: Further configurations for the rolling update strategy:

maxUnavailable: 1: This field specifies the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update process. In this case, it's set to 1, meaning that at most one Pod can be unavailable at any given time during the update. This helps ensure that the application remains available while the update is in progress.

maxSurge: 2: This field specifies the maximum number of additional Pods that can be created during the update process. In this case, it's set to 2, meaning that up to two new Pods can be created simultaneously as part of the update. This can help speed up the update process by introducing additional Pods before scaling down the old ones.

In summary, this Deployment manifest defines an application called "abctechnologies-dep" with two replicas, uses a rolling update strategy to replace old Pods with new ones, and sets specific parameters for controlling the maximum number of unavailable Pods and the maximum number of additional Pods during the update process.

Please revert to this email if you have any other queries, we will be happy to help you.
